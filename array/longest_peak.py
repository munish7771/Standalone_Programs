# Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns the length of the longest peak.
# peak = adjacent integers that are strictly increasing until they reach a peak after that they become strictly decreasing. At minimum three integers are required to form a peak.

# eg - 1,4,10,2 form a peak, but 4,0,10 dont
# 1,2,2,0 also do not form a peak
# 1,2,3 do not form a peak because there is no decreasing integer after 3.
